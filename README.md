# üß™ Experiment 2 - Data Types and Operators in C++

## üéØ Aim:
To study and implement:
- Various data types in C++
- Usage of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Behavior of expressions using different operators and data types

---

## üß† Theory:

In C++, **data types** define the nature of data that a variable can hold. **Operators** are symbols that perform operations on data values and variables.

### ‚û§ 1. Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description                     | Example        |
|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| `int`     | Stores whole numbers             | 5, -10, 1000   |
| `float`   | Stores decimal values (6 digits precision) | 3.14, 0.5 |
| `double`  | Stores larger decimal values (15 digits precision) | 2.718281828459045 |
| `char`    | Stores a single character        | 'A', 'z'       |
| `bool`    | Stores true or false             | `true`, `false` |

Each variable in C++ must be declared with a type before it can be used.

### ‚û§ 2. Operators in C++

#### ‚û§ Arithmetic Operators:
Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description        | Example      |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b`      |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b`      |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b`      |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b`      |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder)  | `a % b`      |

#### ‚û§ Relational Operators:
Used to compare two values and return a boolean result.

| Operator | Description         | Example     |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `==`     | Equal to             | `a == b`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `a != b`    |
| `<`      | Less than            | `a < b`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `a > b`     |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `a <= b`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `a >= b`    |

#### ‚û§ Logical Operators:
Used for combining two or more conditions.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND           | `(a > 5 && b < 10)`   |
| `||`     | Logical OR            | `(a > 5 || b < 10)`   |
| `!`      | Logical NOT           | `!(a == b)`           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure:

1. Open your preferred IDE or text editor and create a new C++ file.
2. Use `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std;` at the beginning.
3. Declare variables of different data types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`).
4. Initialize values and perform operations using:
   - Arithmetic operators
   - Relational operators
   - Logical operators
5. Use `cout` statements to print the results of expressions.
6. Compile and run the program to observe the output.

## üîç Learning Outcomes:

- Learned about different data types and their memory usage
- Applied various arithmetic and relational operators
- Observed how logical operators evaluate conditions
- Strengthened understanding of how C++ evaluates expressions

---

## üìå Key Concepts Covered:

- Data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Operator usage: arithmetic, relational, logical
- Expression evaluation

## üìù Experiment Summary:

This experiment provided hands-on exposure to **how C++ handles data** and **how operators function** on different variables. From mathematical calculations to comparing values and making logical decisions, understanding data types and operators is crucial for writing clear, correct, and efficient C++ programs.
